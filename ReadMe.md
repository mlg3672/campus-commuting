# Campus Commuting Project

## Purpose
1. To demonstrate the effectiveness of policy initiatives. 
2. To reduce carbon footprint (to zero) for campuses with respect to  transportation [scope 1 emissions].
3. To explore the relationship between commuting behavior (e.g.frequency, distance, modal mix) with commuter demographics (e.g. vehicle mpg, income, housing, student/faculty/staff)

## Approach
### Part I. 
Explore relationship between public transportation options (e.g. distance vs. bus time) using google maps API. 

### Part II.
linear regression between variables (taken from campus wide survey)
Percent single-occupant vehicle in miles = ax1 + bx2 + cx3 

#### variables include:
vehicle mpg
bus time
demographic info: student/staff/faculty
cost spent on fuel
modal share
income (inferred by fuel cost, location)
location (inferred by distance and demographic info)

### Part III. 
scenario analysis - policies to increase shared vehicle trips
A. increasing parking cost (e.g. increase per trip cost)
B. green procurement 
C. improving public transport (e.g. decrease bus time, expand bus routes)
